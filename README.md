## Technologies and Tools

This project was created with Vue Cli 3 which is a standard tooling for Vue.js development

- https://cli.vuejs.org/

* Vue.js
* SCSS, ESLint
* Npm
* Web server with Node (Express) for development with HMR
* Node js
* Webpack
* IDE: Visual Studio Code and extensions

## Decisions

The project is created with VUE.js and is created for test purpose.

I separated the logic in single components to achieve the main purpose of the web.

Each component owns its own logic depending on the type of data that manages.

Vue router is used for manage the different views in the app and render different components depending on it.

For styling I used SCSS connected to Vue architecture. There is a global.css file.

## Views

Web is divided in two parts (each of them is a link in the header navbar):

- Home
- Vacation
